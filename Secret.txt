I think I'm beginning to fall in love with Halleluyah. 

I don't understand what's wrong with me.

Did you think I should tell her or I should just live with it. 

But it seems she is having boyfriend. 

what should I do?

But seriously I will love to have her by my side.

I felt she would be a perfect match for me; I mean talking of her intelligence, sacarsm, beauty, smile and all.
she felt like the perfect person for me. 

And i hope she felt the same for me. 

Men, I don dey fall in love sha.
